No announcements of super awesome features, some random ramblings that may or may not be true.  Of course, we are always rolling out new features and our UI changes from day to day.  And, it’s all personalised – the UI presents what’s relevant to you and some of you might even be lucky enough to receive new features before we roll it out to everyone.\nWe use two major backend components to control this.  First, we have an ab testing framework that we can use to rollout features to random subsets of users, grouped by region, platform and client version.  Second, we have a sophisticated UI content framework that accepts JSON data to render certain pages throughout the app with the latest and most relevant data for that user.  Multiple backends can provide the content and the clients interpret the data and render it in a consistent way natively.",

With the vast range of libraries your app can do everything that Android is capable of.\nThat is to say, that this is not an ‘app builder’ aimed at people who don’t want to do any coding. You will have to code but it’s more accessible for beginners and there are a lot of neat features to make the process simpler.\nThere are more unique advantages of Basic4Android too. One is that it is part of a ‘B4x’ suite of tools, along with ‘B4J’ (Basic4Java) and ‘B4i. In other words, because the syntax is largely the same for Basic4Android, Basic4Java and Basic4iOS, you can create a simple app on the PC and then swap out some libraries and platform-specific features in order to port it to both Android and iPhone.You can also use B4J to make simple little desktop apps for your own purposes, or to create apps that need to communicate with the computer or a server.",

Third-party SDKs appear every day promising to aid this process, instead they bring friction and integration challenges – is it worth the effort? More often the answer is no, as many of them need a significant amount of effort to become embedded in an app. Building SDKs for seamless integration is a challenge, especially when you have to deal on the view level. So how do we attack the two-minute integration challenge?\nIn this session we will discuss a set of good practices on how to build a well-structured SDK focusing on the view level. We will take a deep-dive into the different options available for rendering overlays on Android – particularly through an SDK – highlighting capabilities and limitations of each approach. Over the course of the session we will explore the various technical decisions an SDK developer has to make to overcome platform limitations, focusing on how to provide a minimalistic interaction with the SDK users, while still keeping the full functionality of the SDK under the hood.",
